# Prelude Libraries

Prelude maintains a collection of open-source libraries that interact with [Detect](https://docs.preludesecurity.com/docs/the-basics).

You must have a [Prelude Account](https://docs.preludesecurity.com/docs/prelude-account) to use these libraries. 

## What's here

Libraries are organized by language and categorized into Probes, SDK(s), and Tests.

### Probes
A [probe](https://docs.preludesecurity.com/recipes/probes) is an endpoint process that knows how to run security tests. Probes are lightweight and open-source.

### SDK

Software Development Kit (SDK) allows you to build your own tooling against the Prelude Service API. The [Prelude CLI](https://docs.preludesecurity.com/recipes/cli) is an example application built on top of the Python SDK.

### Tests

Security tests are production ready TTPs. Tests from this repository are automatically loaded into Detect and can be run immediately on any endpoint.
