# Hades

> One of Chopin's 24 Preludes. Hades is considered by many to be the most difficult of the Chopin preludes.[2] Hans von BÃ¼low dubbed this prelude "Hades." It was composed between 1836 and 1839, published in 1839 and dedicated to Camille Pleyel who commissioned the opus 28 preludes for 2,000 francs.

# Usage

Install with:

```bash
go get github.com/preludeorg/detect-clients/go/probe
```

Include Hades in a project with:

```golang
package main

import (
    hades "github.com/preludeorg/detect-clients/go/probe/pkg/service"
)

func main() {
    ps := hades.CreateService()
    if err := ps.Register(); err == nil {
        ps.Start()
    }
}
```

You can also manually load configurations from a keychain file and specify a name with:

```golang
package main

import (
    hades "github.com/preludeorg/detect-clients/go/probe/pkg/service"
)

func main() {
    ps := hades.CreateService()
	err := ps.LoadKeychain("/path/to/keychain.ini")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
    }
    if err = ps.Register("my-amazing-probe"); err == nil {
        ps.Start()
    }
}
```

## Development

For local testing you can use:
```bash
go run cmd/hades/hades.go
```
