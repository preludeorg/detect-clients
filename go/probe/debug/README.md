# Debug probe

Compile the debug probe for any platform you want to run it on:

> GOOS can be darwin, linux or windows

```go
GOOS=darwin go build
```

Copy ``debug`` to any computer and run any Detect test on demand:
```bash
./debug
[P] Enter a test ID:
```

Optionally, you can override the probe hostname using the host argument:
```
./debug -host goober
```
